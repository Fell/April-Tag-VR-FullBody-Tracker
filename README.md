# April-Tag-VR-FullBody-Tracker
Full-body tracking in VR using AprilTag markers.

## Windows x64 Only Kinect Version

This is my personal fork of https://github.com/ju1ce/April-Tag-VR-FullBody-Tracker. The goal is to implement the Kinect Camera natively for tracking and improve performance, accuracy and usability while dropping platform independency.

I want to achieve a production ready build for VR gamers on Windows PCs who are looking for a cheap alternative to Vive tracking.

I do not want to replace the original project, I just want to take my own approach for myself.
